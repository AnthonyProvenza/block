# Blip
=====
Blip, short for **Bl**ock **I**mport **P**ackage (*manager*) is a tool bundled with block to make downloading and installing packages as quick and easy as possible, so that you can spend less time fighting your computer, and more time coding.

*Note:* This tutorial assumes that you are working in the directory where Blip is located (and in some examples, where your other files are located)

# Usage
## Simple Usage
To start Blip, make sure you're in the directory where it is located, then in the terminal run
```bash
user@device ~ $ python blip.py
```
This will start the Blip CLI, where you can run commands without having to use the `python blip` prefix in the terminal. While that is the case, the rest of this tutorial will assume that you are running commands from the shell and not from the Blip interface

## Compressing a Package
Compressing a package is not yet complete, but is what I am currently finishing up. It should be released this evening

## Installing a Package
I have already tested (and almost made) the installing packages stored on your computer function. I'll release it shortly after releasing the compression section

## Uninstalling a Package
Uninstalling packages is yet to be started. Sorry

## Downloading and Installing Remote Packages
This is a rather ambitious idea, but I have a rough idea how to do it. The packages will be stored on github though, so packages may be on here before this function is ready
